Data on Walmart :
______

What we wanted :
- Time period : from January 31, 2015 to January 31, 2017
- List of all Walmart stores that opened or closed in this time period
- Closing and opening dates : precision : at least month
- Precise address (most important : State, County, City)
- Each store's category

Starting point : 
- Fandom database (collaborative online platform under CC-BY-SA) on Walmart : list of all
  Walmart stores in the US (current or former store) :
   - with store's address (state, city, address)
   - with store's Walmart unique id
   - with store's category (Walmart, Walmart Supercenter, Neighborhood Market, Clinic Pharmacy, Convenience with Fuel, Walmart Pickup)
   - with store's opening date (MM/DD/YYYY)
   - with store's closing date (MM/DD/YYYY) when former Walmart store
   - all existing stores (beginning of Walmart - 2022)
   Not sufficient : non exhaustive dataset (unverified data, potential mistakes on address, store id, dates, not precise enough dates (only month, year), missing stores)
   => necessity to verify data with other sources

Verification and completion data :
- Walmart's annual reports : 2015, 2016, 2017 (nb of stores on January 31, per state and category - SC, NM and other small formats, Walmart)
  How we used it : we verified that our numbers were in accordance with these data
- Ascertaining dates, id, category, address : Walmart's website, Walmart's statements (especially Jan. 15, 2016 statement about closings in 2016),
  Google Maps data, Facebook store's pages data, online reviews (foursquare, yelp, Google), pharmacy-near-me, healthcare6, local newspapers articles, ...
- Finding missing stores : local newspapers articles, other databases (A, B and C - cf readme)...

Choices we made when collecting data / remarks :
- Some stores changed categories, which category should we choose ? The last one.
- Walmart Express category (not part of fandom database at first) : we decided to regroup the stores from this category with those of the "Neighborhood Market (formerly Walmart Express)" category.
- Stores that opened before the beginning of the period of interest or closed after it : if we were sure of the year only, we put January 1, year, if of the year and month only we put Month 1 (having only month-year or year caused issues in data treatment).
- We did not look into Puerto Rico's data.

Types of stores we decided to focus on :
- Stores for non-professional consumers : no Sam's Clubs.
  Reasons : convenience for data verification and data availability (no Sam's Club in fandom database,
  nor in Walmart's reports), relevance (for Sam's Clubs, special functionning with membership cards and big formats).
- Question concerning Nielsen database : which stores' sizes?
- Question : relevance of studying small formats (some NM formerly WE, Clinic Pharmmacy, Convenience with fuel).
- We noticed that some Neighborhood Markets (formerly Walmart Express) were small format stores (when compared to other NM).

Conclusion on assumptions and bias : Various characteristics encompassed in same category Neighborhood Market ; only last category taken into account
(had it changed already in 2015 ?) ; possible flaws in dataset although checked with Walmart's reports (see next point).

Robustness of data : See Excel sheet (check : Google researches, newspapers articles, and above all Walmart's annual reports).

Plotting the data - getting each store's localisation (GPS coordinates) and county :
______

Goal : Having a first glimpse on our Walmart data, identifying states and counties where entries and exits happened, having a broad view
of the information.

Selected means : Interactive maps displaying each store's opening or closing, for both the entire country (thus enabling comparisons between
 states) and each state (comparisons between counties).

Reasoning : We don't have access to each store's precise GPS coordinates, but we know their address and therefore city. Let's 
automize our location's data research by associating each store to its city's GPS coordinates rather than its own precise ones.
Because what matters most to us is the county not the precise location, on the assumption that the city is entirely included in a single
county and that each store is indeed part of the city its address shows, we get satisfying information on each store's location by
only using the city's coordinates.

Starter dataset : US Cities free database from Simple Maps company (= uscities.csv)
 - Data sources : US Geological Survey and US Census Bureau.
 - Data collection : Simple Maps.
 - Licence : Creative Commons Attribution 4.0.
 - Up to date : last update May 2022.
 - 30,409 entries (no unincorporated populated areas, only bigger cities)

Process : merger of our walmart stores' data and US cities' database on city's name.

Fixing merging issues :
 - Issue 1 : different spelling between the two databases.
   Decision we made : uniformization done by hand state by state.
 - Issue 2 : Walmart stores' whose city was not part of the US cities' database.
    - First case : store part of unincorporated area
      Decision we made : either we added unincorporated area as new entry in uscities (new GPS decimal coordinates found on the Internet), either we changed store's address in fandom,
      replacing actual city by nearest city already part of uscities (after checking no change of county).
    - Second case : store part of a citywhich not identified as such in cities' database (neighborhood within the city with GPS 
      coordinates in cities' database not the city).
      Decision we made : either we changed store's address in fandom and put neighborhood's name instead of city's name, either
      we added city as new entry in uscities (new GPS decimal coordinates found on the Internet).

Conclusion on assumptions and bias : We considered that the city is entirely included in a single county and that each store is indeed part of the city its address shows.

Plotting the data - getting a county basemap of the US :
______

Dataset (= shape.shp) : Cartographic Boundary File from the US Census Bureau (year 2018), 3233 entries.

Conclusion on assumptions and bias : simplified geometric representation (not exact precise boundaries).

Incorporating county population density in our data - plotting it :

Final goal : better county matching in diff in diff.

To sum up :
______

Our databases - description :

Still need to expand on A, B and C databases and on Excel sheet, on how we dealt with possibility that two cities in the same state
bear same name.
