Top sum up : between 3 and 4 dollars per Gallon for 2015-2016.

Milk pricing mechanisms in the US (focus on fluid milk):
Several mechanisms, on several scales :
- on the federal scale, Federal Milk Marketing Orders (FMMO) : minimum price that a manufacturer
pays to the farmer. Fluid milk : class I. New value each month, for fluid milk not the same value
for all the country (areas). Minimum price for fluid milk based on the two former weeks milk final
prices, then formulas give minimmum price per area.
- such mechanisms exist at the state-level or substate-level as well (eg Western New York State 
Milk Marketing Order)
- maybe others ?

Questions :
- Specific question about FMMO : does the minimum price has an impact on retailers' prices ? Or is it, 
on the contrary, manufacturers'(maybe induced by retailer pressure) or directly retailers' prices that 
set the minimum price ? 
I don't know. However, whatever the answer we know there is a strong correlation btw manufacturers or 
retailer milk prices and minimum prices. Taking this into account, looking at minimum prices variations'
magnitude for years 2015 and 2016 might tell us whether external causes affect milk prices : if strong 
variations across markets and/or months, our regression model would have to account for it. And indeed we
observe such strong variations : the value is entirely different for each month, and different areas have
different values even for the same month. However for two different areas for each month the value 
differs only by a constant (that stays the same for the entire year). Therefore time fixed effects and
area fixed effects alone should be able to account for it. However the areas in question have not
necessarily the same boundaries as states' ones... There is an issue here.
- How do we account for other than FMMO Marketing Orders (that focus on substate areas for example) ?
- Can Walmart's entry or exit decisions affect minimum prices ? (I don't think so, maybe Walmart has an 
impact, but not one single opening or closing) If this is the case, fixed effects won't be sufficient for
our model...

Conclusion : milk might be too complicated a market for us to use it as a proxy of entry/exit induced
consumer inflation.
